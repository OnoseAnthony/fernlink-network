        <P>
          Every Solana wallet, every dApp, every trading bot shares the same
          chokepoint: a handful of centralized RPC providers. When those providers slow
          down, every application on the network slows with them. When they go offline,
          transactions stop confirming. And as Solana's transaction volume grows, the
          cost of hammering those endpoints grows too.
        </P>
        <P>
          We built Fernlink to break that dependency. Today we're open-sourcing the full
          protocol stack: a peer-to-peer mesh that lets nearby devices collaboratively
          verify Solana transactions and share the cryptographic proof, so one RPC call
          does the work of many.
        </P>

        <H2>// THE_PROBLEM</H2>
        <P>
          Solana processes hundreds of thousands of transactions per day. For each one,
          every interested device (wallet, POS terminal, IoT node) makes its own
          independent call to an RPC endpoint to confirm the transaction is settled.
          That's a massive, duplicated load on a small number of infrastructure providers.
        </P>
        <P>
          The consequences compound in the real world:
        </P>
        <ul className="mb-6 space-y-1">
          <Bullet>
            <strong className="text-[#22C55E]">Cost at scale.</strong> High-volume applications pay for millions of RPC calls per day. Those costs flow through to developers and end users.
          </Bullet>
          <Bullet>
            <strong className="text-[#22C55E]">Single points of failure.</strong> Provider outages cascade across the entire ecosystem simultaneously. There is no fallback.
          </Bullet>
          <Bullet>
            <strong className="text-[#22C55E]">The connectivity gap.</strong> Billions of potential Solana users live in regions with intermittent internet. An RPC-dependent model excludes them entirely.
          </Bullet>
        </ul>

        <H2>// THE_SOLUTION</H2>
        <P>
          Fernlink introduces a three-phase mesh protocol that distributes verification
          across the devices that are already in the room.
        </P>
        <div className="bg-black border border-[#064e3b] p-6 terminal-border my-6 space-y-5">
          {[
            ["01 REQUEST", "A device needing verification broadcasts a signed request over BLE, WiFi Direct, or NFC. The message contains the transaction signature, desired commitment level, and a TTL."],
            ["02 VERIFY", "A peer with RPC access checks the transaction against the Solana ledger, signs the result with its Ed25519 key, and returns a compact proof."],
            ["03 PROPAGATE", "The proof spreads through the mesh via gossip. Each hop is tracked. UUID deduplication prevents replays. When enough independent verifiers agree, the transaction is settled."],
          ].map(([label, desc]) => (
            <div key={label} className="flex gap-4">
              <span className="font-mono text-[#22C55E] text-xs uppercase tracking-widest shrink-0 pt-0.5 w-24">{label}</span>

            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
        <P>
          The result: in a dense environment like a conference hall, a market, or a city block,
          one RPC call can settle verification for dozens of nearby devices.
          Our modelling puts the RPC reduction at <Highlight>60–80%</Highlight> in realistic mesh scenarios.
        </P>

        <H2>// SECURITY_MODEL</H2>
        <P>
          Distributing trust across unknown peers only works if the cryptography is tight.
          Fernlink's security properties:
        </P>
        <ul className="mb-6 space-y-1">
          <Bullet>
            Every proof is <Highlight>Ed25519 signed</Highlight> by the verifying node. Proofs cannot be forged or attributed to a different verifier.
          </Bullet>
          <Bullet>
            <Highlight>Multi-validator consensus</Highlight> with a configurable threshold, default 2+ independent proofs, before a transaction is considered settled. One compromised peer can't unilaterally confirm.
          </Bullet>
          <Bullet>
            <Highlight>UUID deduplication with TTL</Highlight> prevents replay attacks. Each proof ID can only be accepted once within its validity window.
          </Bullet>

            <Highlight>No private keys traverse the mesh.</Highlight> Only transaction signatures and verification proofs are shared between peers.

        <H2>// TRY_IT_NOW</H2>
        <P>
          The fastest way to see Fernlink in action is the devnet demo. It spins up three
          simulated mesh peers, sends a real SOL transfer on devnet, routes the verification
          request through the peer mesh, and prints each signed proof alongside the final
          consensus result. No hardware required.
